# Airdrop Reputation

## `setAirdropAmount`

```
npx ts-node cli/index.ts setAirdropAmount
                  [-h] [-e ETH_PROVIDER] 
                  -x CONTRACT 
                  -a AIRDROP 
                  (-dp | -d ETH_PRIVKEY)
```

* The attester that has [registered](https://github.com/vivianjeng/UniRep/blob/git-book/introduction/README.md#1.-registration) in UniRep can set the airdrop amount and give it to users that register through the attester's account/smart contract.
* UniRep contract will also set the sign up flag to `1`.

### Options

```
  -e ETH_PROVIDER, --eth-provider ETH_PROVIDER
                        A connection string to an Ethereum provider. Default: http://localhost:8545
  -x CONTRACT, --contract CONTRACT
                        The Unirep contract address
  -a AIRDROP, --airdrop AIRDROP
                        The amount of airdrop positive reputation given by the attester
  -dp, --prompt-for-eth-privkey
                        Whether to prompt for the user's Ethereum private key and ignore -d / --eth-privkey
  -d ETH_PRIVKEY, --eth-privkey ETH_PRIVKEY
                        The deployer's Ethereum private key
```

## `genUserSignUpProof`

```
npx ts-node cli/index.ts genUserSignUpProof
                  [-h] 
                  [-e ETH_PROVIDER] 
                  -id IDENTITY 
                  -a ATTESTER_ID 
                  [-b START_BLOCK] 
                  -x CONTRACT
```

* Attester can give user a sign up flag to indicate the user is one of the membership of the attester's application (or event).
* Then user can generate a sign up proof to show that he has been authenticated by the attester.
* See [user sign up proof](../circuits/user-sign-up-proof.md)

## `giveAirdrop`

```
npx ts-node cli/index.ts giveAirdrop
                  [-h] 
                  [-e ETH_PROVIDER] 
                  -p PUBLIC_SIGNALS
